Open-Source crappy scraper bot for pinterest just put in a url and it will do its thing and scrape everything

read if you want I dont care

Make sure to have Opera GX downloaded if on pc, You can get it from this download link: https://www.opera.com/gx, Otherwise you will need to recode the download bit, This is mainly for pinterest but yk do what you want this is open source, Also idk if you need the login session for ios or android please dm me on discord if it needed and if i need to recode it or anything

please run opera_login_session first so you login to pinterest inside of the browser otherwise it will be stuck on the login screen not doing anything

run this in your directory for the script

pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install

Discord: atltx
Server: Not Setup Yet

I'm currently testing this on ios so be patient
